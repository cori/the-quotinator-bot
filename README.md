The Quotinator Bot
==================

1. Pick a random tweet
1. From within it pick a random word
1. Put the word in quotes and quote-retweet the original tweet with the "word"

> #botidea: replies to random tweets with a random word from that tweet but in quotes
    
_Can't reply without opt-in per Twitter ToS, which limits the "utility" of the bot. Also quote-retweets are not properly handled in the Twitter API, so there's that. Basically means this is on mothballs for now_
